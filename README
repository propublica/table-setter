Installation Note

- Rack 2.x has not `rack/showexceptions` but `rack/show_exceptions`.
    - cf. [Incorrect rack requirement for showexceptions file · Issue \#1055 · sinatra/sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/1055)
- so you must specify rack version '< 2.0.0' such as below (Gemfile)

```Gemfile
gem 'table_setter'
gem 'rack', '< 2.0.0'
```
